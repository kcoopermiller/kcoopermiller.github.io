# Blogs coming soon!

It probably isn't styled much, but these blogs currently does support:

Inline equation: <Latex formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" displayMode={false} /> yay!

Block equation: <Latex formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" displayMode={true} /> yay!

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/post1/`

```python
def f(x):
    return x**2
```


- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!
